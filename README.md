# Daily Budget (Team 11)

## The team
This is a simple app developed by Vera Maria Soterio, Raquel Brand√£o, Carisa Rubim, Fernanda Massirer, Monique Invernizzi e Jucieli Baschirotto

## The idea
The idea of the app is to calculate how much you had expense day by day, setting a max daily budget and discounting 
each cash outflow from that day, and showing to you how much you had expense in a specific day and showing
all this expenses classified by month in an index page.

## Using in your computer
1. `git clone git@github.com:RailsGirlsPoa2014/DailyBudget.git`
2. `cd daily_budget/`
3. `bundle install`
4. `rake db:create db:migrate`
5. `rails server`

Now your server is running, and you can access the application from `http://localhost:3000`
